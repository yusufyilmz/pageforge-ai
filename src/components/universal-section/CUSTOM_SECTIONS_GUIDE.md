      title: "Calculate Your ROI",
      packages: [...],
      onCalculate: (result) => trackConversion(result)
    }
  }}

```

### With API Endpoints

```typescript
// Generated sections can include API integration
const generatedSection = aiSectionFactory.generateSectionFromDescription(
  'Create a real-time dashboard showing sales metrics from our CRM API',

)
```

## ðŸ’¡ Tips for Best Results

1. **Include Context**: Mention your industry, target audience, and business goals
2. **Describe Data**: What information will populate the section?
3. **User Journey**: How do users interact with this section?
4. **Integration**: Does it connect to other systems or pages?
5. **Constraints**: Any technical limitations or requirements?
