# Universal Section System - Enhanced AI Generator

The Universal Section System is an advanced AI-powered section generation framework that can create complex, interactive, and industry-specific sections from natural language descriptions. This system has been significantly enhanced to handle "some other sections" - meaning any type of custom, unique, or specialized section beyond basic patterns.

## üöÄ Major Enhancements

### Enhanced Pattern Recognition
- **20+ Element Types**: Basic (team, gallery, contact) + Advanced (charts, timelines, accordions, tabs, carousels, counters, progress bars, maps) + Interactive (modals, hover effects, scroll animations, form submissions, API calls) + Custom (pricing plans, blog posts, products, completely custom components)
- **Smart Natural Language Processing**: Detects intent, style preferences, interaction requirements, and business-specific needs
- **Context-Aware Analysis**: Understands industry terminology and specialized requirements

### Advanced Layout Generation
- **Grid Layouts**: Enhanced with different element types (cards, charts, progress bars, counters, images)
- **Tabs Layout**: Tabbed content with navigation and dynamic content switching
- **Accordion Layout**: Collapsible sections with expand/collapse functionality
- **Timeline Layout**: Both horizontal and vertical timelines with events and milestones
- **Carousel Layout**: Content sliders with navigation controls and autoplay
- **Form Layout**: Dynamic forms with conditional fields and validation
- **Custom Layouts**: Fallback system for unique, industry-specific requirements

## üöÄ Usage Examples

### Basic Usage in Chat
```typescript
import { useSectionGenerator } from './hooks/useSectionGenerator'

const { generateSection, isGenerating, lastGenerated } = useSectionGenerator()

// User types: "I want a contact form"
await generateSection("I want a contact form")

// Result: New section type "contact-form" is now available
```

### Integration with Your Chat System
```typescript
import { handleChatMessage } from './ChatSectionGenerator'

const response = await handleChatMessage("Add a pricing table with 3 plans")
// Returns: "‚úÖ Successfully created a PricingTable section! You can now add it to your page with type 'pricing-table'."
```

## üéØ Supported Section Types

The AI can generate any type of section based on natural language. Here are examples:

### Team/Staff Sections
```
"I need a team section with employee photos and bios"
"Add a staff page with social media links"
"Create an about us section showing our team"
```
**Generates:** Card-based layout with photos, names, roles, bios, social links

### Contact Forms
```
"Add a contact form to my page"
"I need a way for customers to reach us"
"Create a contact section with a form"
```
**Generates:** Form with validation, styled inputs, submit handling

### Image Galleries
```
"Create a portfolio gallery"
"I want to show my work images"
"Add a photo gallery with lightbox"
```
**Generates:** Grid layout with lightbox, lazy loading, responsive design

### Customer Reviews
```
"Add customer testimonials with ratings"
"I want to show reviews on my site"
"Create a testimonials section with star ratings"
```
**Generates:** Review cards with star ratings, customer photos, filtering

### Pricing Tables
```
"Add a pricing section with 3 plans"
"Create subscription plans comparison"
"I need a pricing table for my services"
```
**Generates:** Comparison table, featured plans, call-to-action buttons

### Service Showcases

if (block.type === 'hero') return <HeroSection />
if (block.type === 'features') return <FeaturesSection />
// ... 30+ more statements

// After: AI-powered automatic loading
import { AIUniversalSections } from './AIUniversalSections'
export const UniversalSections = AIUniversalSections
```

### 2. Add Chat Integration
```typescript
import { AISectionChatDemo } from './AISectionChatDemo'

<AISectionChatDemo
  onSectionGenerated={(type, name) => {
    console.log(`New section created: ${name} (${type})`)
    // Add to your page builder, refresh UI, etc.
  }}
/>
```

### 3. Use in Your Chat System
```typescript
import { useSectionGenerator } from './hooks/useSectionGenerator'

const ChatInterface = () => {
  const { generateSection, lastGenerated } = useSectionGenerator()

  const handleMessage = async (message: string) => {
    await generateSection(message)
    if (lastGenerated) {
      // Section was created! Update your UI
      addSectionToPage(lastGenerated.sectionType)
    }
  }
}
```

## üí° Advanced Features

### Intelligent Content Suggestions
```typescript
// User: "I need a team section"
// AI generates with sample content:
{
  title: "Our Team",
  description: "Meet the amazing people behind our success",
  members: [
    {
      name: "John Doe",
      role: "CEO & Founder",
      bio: "Visionary leader with 10+ years experience",
      image: "/placeholder-avatar.jpg",
      social: {
        linkedin: "https://linkedin.com/in/johndoe",
        twitter: "https://twitter.com/johndoe"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

### Layout Intelligence
The AI chooses appropriate layouts based on content type:
- **Grid Layout**: For teams, galleries, services
- **Two-Column**: For feature comparisons, about sections
- **Hero Layout**: For banners, call-to-actions
- **Single Column**: For forms, testimonials

### Style Adaptation
Sections automatically adapt to your design system:
- Uses your existing color palette
- Matches typography scale
- Follows spacing conventions
- Respects breakpoint system
